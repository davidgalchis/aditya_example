# Full Stack React Website Example

This example uses CloudKommand to deploy an S3-hosted React website and then uses AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, IAM, and API Gateway to create an API that you can hit to increment a counter.

Use the kommand.json at the base level of this repo, combined with the folder structure, to develop your own application, and check out the CloudKommand-managed plugins at:

- IAM (role and policy): https://github.com/cloudkommand/iam 
- Lambda (function and layer): https://github.com/cloudkommand/lambda
- S3: https://github.com/cloudkommand/s3
- API Gateway: https://github.com/cloudkommand/apigateway
- DynamoDB: https://github.com/cloudkommand/dynamodb
- React Apps (website hosting with CDN and DNS): https://github.com/cloudkommand/reactapp
